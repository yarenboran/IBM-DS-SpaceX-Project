SpaceX Mission Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing SpaceX launch data to gain insights into mission outcomes, success rates, and other key metrics. Using Python, Pandas, and various visualization tools, the analysis includes:

Data Collection & Wrangling: Gathering and cleaning data from SpaceX missions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and patterns in launch outcomes, payloads, and more.
Predictive Analysis: Building models to predict mission success using logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors.
Interactive Visualizations: Creating dashboards and maps to interactively explore the data.
The analysis aims to provide a comprehensive view of SpaceX's launch performance and identify factors influencing mission success.
